MScR Project - Stellar rotation formalisms of Î³ Doradus stars from gravity-mode period spacings

(Updated 14/12/2019)

This repository contains the files in MESA astero module that are edited and/or created to compute 
frequencies with TAR and 2nd-order perturbative method. 

work_bench_gyre is an example work dir for TAR computation with GYRE.
work_bench_adipls is an example work dir for 2nd-Pert computation with ADIPLS.
These two particular work directories were used for generating benchmarks in our project, but they 
are also suitable for grid scanning. 

work_gGbA_fine_2 is an example work dir used for GYRE fine grid scanning.

src contains the edited src codes in astero module
[Note that these are NOT the src files inside the work directories]

The src codes are coupled to the edited version of ADIPLS provided in the 'adipls' repository. 



# Instructions

Replace your local astero/src with the src in here.
Then add the work directories work_bench_gyre and work_bench_adipls to your astero directory.

Replace the mesa-r10398/adipls/adipack.c/adipls with adipls in the 'adipls' repository. 
Recompile the entire MESA to generate the object files.

Copy work_bench_gyre/work_bench_adipls to create a new working directory for your project. 
cd to this work directory to compute pulsation freqs with TAR/2nd-Pert formalism.  
Compile the work directory to begin. 

---- For GYRE directories ----

Edit inlist_astero for model controls.
Use input file gyre.in for pulsation controls, then run the command ./rn, 
and then $GYRE_DIR/bin/gyre ./gyre.in 

Alternatively, use the grid scanning tool run_gyre 
by running the command ./run_gyre 

---- For ADIPLS directories ----

Edit inlist_astero for model controls
Use input file inlist_pulse_controls for pulsation controls,
then run the command ./rn

Alternatively, use the grid scanning tool run_adipls 
by running the command ./run_adipls
