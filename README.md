This repository contains the files in MESA astero module that are edited and/or created to compute 
frequencies with TAR and 2nd-order perturbative method. 

work_bench_gyre is an example work dir for TAR computation with GYRE.
work_bench_adipls is an example work dir for 2nd Pert. with ADIPLS.
[Note that the src files in these work directories are edited]
work_gGbA_fine_2 is an example work dir for grid scanning with GYRE.
src are the edited src codes in astero module

The src codes in work_bench_adipls and astero are coupled to the edited version of ADIPLS provided 
in the other repository. Replacing all files in the corresponding MESA astero and adipls modules are 
required for the codes to function.
