! Notes on special_output: (copied from adipls.c.d)

c  ispcpr: if ispcpr .ne. 0 special output may be produced by
c          call of user-supplied routine spcout.
c  Also used to define type of frequency stored in common/cobs_param/
c  (see s/r setobs_st for details):
c  ispcpr = 1: variational frequency.
c  ispcpr = 4: from eigenfrequency in cs(20).
c              Note that this allows setting Cowling
c              approximation frequency.
c  ispcpr = 5: from Richardson extrapolation frequency
c              in cs(37), if this is set.
c              Otherwise variational frequency is used.
c  ispcpr = 6: from (possibly corrected) eigenfrequency in cs(21).
